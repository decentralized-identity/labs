## Summary

## Motivation

## Coordination/Correspondence

- Bi-weekly updates on progress and blockers
- Monthly community calls for feedback and discussion
- GitHub discussions for technical proposals
- Regular documentation updates

## Prior Art

Write related works with explanations and some context.

- Status List
- Camenischâ€“Lysyanskaya (CL) accumulator schemes.
- Idemix / U-Prove
- Revocation bitmap scheme (Hyperledger Indy AnonCreds)
- etc....

## Unresolved Questions

- Performance vs. privacy: Which accumulator variant balances proof size and verification cost?
- Standards alignment: How to map the chosen design to existing DIF & W3C data models?
- Key management: Issuer-side key rotation without breaking accumulator state.

## Outputs

1. Comparative Analysis Report (PDF/Markdown): Detailed survey of revocation approaches, with privacy and performance metrics.
2. Reference Implementation: A modular library (TypeScript/Rust) demonstrating the selected privacy-preserving revocation protocol.
3. Demo Application: Simple verifier/holder demo showing end-to-end issuance, presentation, and revocation checks.
4. (Optional) Spec Proposal: A draft specification for a privacy-preserving revocation extension, to be completed if time and community consensus allow.
