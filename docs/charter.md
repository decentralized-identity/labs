## Scope

The Incubation Labs Working Group (ILWG) serves as an incubation
environment for decentralized identity-based user applications and spec
implementations. The WG provides an IP-safe environment for general
implementation-related discussion, and allows participants to propose and
participate in WG Work Items, each of which is focused on a user application
and/or spec implementation.

##  Deliverables

Deliverables may vary from each working item. The following are examples of some
of the possible deliverables:

* Documentation : Document and discuss use cases 
* Specifications : Develop specifications for various uses 
* Code : Develop open source software as references toward use cases
* Interoperability Profiles: Selection of specifications, schemas, and other requirements to establish interoperability
  
## Operating Procedure

* Chairs are bound to the [process](./process.md) defined in this repo.
* Chairs will have ability to transition working items between states
  per the due process defined in the [Process Guidelines](./process.md)
* Ratification to the [process](./process.md) would require approval from all
  co-chairs.
