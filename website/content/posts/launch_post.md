## DIF Labs accelerates Decentralized Identity market innovation

DIF’s commitment to supporting builders and doers in the decentralized identity space has led to the launch of DIF Labs,
an initiative aimed at transforming how decentralized identity solutions are built, tested, and scaled. DIF Labs bridges
the gap between brilliant ideas and market-ready solutions, empowering developers, startups, and industry innovators to
collaborate, experiment, and grow.

## Why DIF Labs?

alt="DIF Labs" style="width: 700px;">

DIF Labs was born from the need for a dedicated space where creators in decentralized identity can focus on practical
innovation. Traditional standards organizations can be slow and formal, while incubators may lack the technical
ecosystem DIF provides. DIF Labs is uniquely positioned to address these gaps, offering participants:

- **Speed and Flexibility**: Projects in DIF Labs aim to achieve milestones within months, not years.
- **Open and Inclusive Governance**: All outputs are open-source and royalty-free, allowing for broad community
  adoption.
- **Knowledge Pool**: Access to a network of expertise across technical, legal, and market domains.

DIF Labs stands apart by supporting real-world applications rather than just standard development. It’s a space where
builders can focus on creating solutions without the bureaucratic overhead typical of many organizations. Projects are
open to any decentralized identity stack, not necessarily based on DIF-based specifications.

## The Beta (β) Cohort: Iterative Process Development

The inaugural DIF Labs Beta Cohort began **November 2024**, and runs through **February 2025**. This first iteration is
a learning process for everyone involved, with high-touch engagement from the chairs to refine the structure and
maximize impact. The chairs hand-selected projects with leads they knew were capable and focused on completing amazing
work.

## [Project: Bitcoin Ordinals Verifiable Credentials Framework](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/labs/blob/main/proposals/btco-vc/btco_vc_proposal.md)
