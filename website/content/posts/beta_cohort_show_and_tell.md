## Overview

Over the past three months, three incredible projects from the **DIF Labs Beta Cohort** have been put through great lengths to
refine and advance groundbreaking proposals that were finalized in November. These projects represent cutting-edge
innovation in decentralized identity, tackling real-world challenges with fresh perspectives and novel approaches.

The **DIF Labs Show and Tell** is the culmination of this journey—a chance to showcase the hard work, insights, and
progress made during the cohort. This is your opportunity to see these projects in action, engage with their creators,
and contribute to the vibrant ecosystem of decentralized identity.
