We're thrilled to announce the official launch of **Beta Cohort 2** of DIF Labs, kicking off on **June 24, 2025**! Building on the success of our inaugural cohort, we're expanding our mission to push the boundaries of decentralized identity with three groundbreaking projects that tackle some of the most pressing challenges in the verifiable credentials ecosystem.

## What's New in Beta Cohort 2

Beta Cohort 2 represents a significant evolution in our approach to decentralized identity research and development. While our first cohort focused on foundational technologies like Bitcoin-based credentials, linked trust systems, and anonymous verification, this new cohort dives deep into the critical infrastructure needed for real-world adoption of verifiable credentials.

### Enhanced Mentorship Program

We're excited to welcome **Brian Richter** and **Agnes Koinange** as mentors for Beta Cohort 2. Both bring invaluable experience from leading projects in our first cohort:

- **Brian Richter**, Founder of Aviary Tech and creator of Ordinals Plus, brings deep expertise in Bitcoin-native identity solutions and verifiable credentials
- **Agnes Koinange**, Technical Director at TrustNet, contributes extensive knowledge in identity infrastructure and credentialing systems

They join our existing expert mentor team, ensuring project leads receive world-class guidance throughout their development journey.

## The Three Pioneering Projects

### 1. Legally-Binding Proof of Personhood for Verifiable Credentials via QES

**Led by Jon Bauer and Roberto Carvajal from Good Future, LLC**

This project addresses a critical gap in current verifiable credentials: the lack of legal recognition and high-assurance identity binding. The team is developing a standardized method to anchor any W3C Verifiable Credential to **Qualified Electronic Signatures (QES)**, which carry the same legal weight as handwritten signatures under European eIDAS regulation.

**Key Innovation**: Any existing VC can be "upgraded" with legally binding attestation, providing embedded KYC assurance and regulatory compliance for high-value transactions.

**Timeline**: June 24 - August 31, 2025

### 2. Privacy-Preserving Revocation Mechanism

**Led by Kai Otsuki and Ken Watanabe**

Revocation is essential for credential ecosystems, but current solutions often expose sensitive information about who requested revocation checks and when. This project delivers the first comprehensive **Systematization of Knowledge (SoK)** for privacy-preserving revocation in verifiable credentials.

**Key Innovation**: A comparative analysis and reference implementation covering status lists, dynamic accumulators, zk-SNARK proofs, and short-term credentials, with practical guidance for implementers.

**Timeline**: June 24 - August 31, 2025

### 3. Anonymous Multi-Signature Verifiable Credentials

**Led by Seohee Park and Lukas Han**

Many organizations require collective decision-making for credential issuance, but lack the tools to do so while preserving privacy. This project introduces a protocol for **m-of-n multi-signature VC issuance** using Semaphore zero-knowledge proofs.

**Key Innovation**: Enables DAOs, government agencies, and multi-stakeholder organizations to issue credentials with cryptographic proof of sufficient approval, while keeping individual signer identities anonymous.

**Timeline**: June 24 - August 31, 2025

## Why These Projects Matter

The three projects in Beta Cohort 2 address fundamental barriers to widespread verifiable credential adoption:

1. **Legal Recognition**: QES integration provides the regulatory compliance needed for government and enterprise adoption
2. **Privacy Infrastructure**: Advanced revocation mechanisms protect user privacy while maintaining system integrity  
3. **Decentralized Governance**: Multi-signature protocols enable new organizational models for credential issuance

Together, these innovations create a more robust, privacy-preserving, and legally compliant foundation for the future of digital identity.

## Kick-Off: June 24, 2025

Beta Cohort 2 officially begins on **June 24, 2025**, with all three project teams starting their intensive development phase. Over the next ten weeks, we'll be sharing regular updates on progress, breakthrough moments, and technical insights from each project.

## What to Expect

Each project team will deliver:

- **Open-source implementations** and libraries
- **Technical specifications** and documentation  
- **Research papers** and comparative analyses
- **Reference demos** showcasing real-world applications
- **Community workshops** and technical discussions

All deliverables will be published openly, ensuring the broader decentralized identity community benefits from these innovations.

## Join the Journey

Follow along with Beta Cohort 2's progress:

- **GitHub**: All projects are developed in the open at [github.com/decentralized-identity/labs](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/labs)
- **Community Calls**: Monthly technical discussions and progress updates
- **Directory**: Meet the [project leads and mentors](https://labs.identity.foundation/directory/) supporting each initiative
- **Updates**: Regular blog posts highlighting milestones and breakthroughs

The future of verifiable credentials is being built today. We invite you to explore these projects, engage with the teams, and help shape the next generation of decentralized identity infrastructure.
