**Great news for builders and researchers!**
We’ve heard from several teams that a little more runway would help them finalize strong proposals. To ensure everyone has the time they need, **the submission deadline for Beta Cohort 2 has been extended to _May 31, 2025_ (23:59 UTC‑7).**

Everything else about the program remains the same—same focus areas, same evaluation criteria, same mentorship and ecosystem support—just more time to polish your ideas.
