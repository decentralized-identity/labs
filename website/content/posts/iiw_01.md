We're coming off the heels of a **successful beta cohort**, and the feedback has been clear: the model works, and there's real demand for focused, high-leverage work at the intersection of **identity, trust, and emerging tech**.

With **many DIF Labs members at IIW**, we’re using this time to **gather ideas, get feedback, and brainstorm tracks** for our next cohort.

## 🔍 Focus Areas Under Exploration

We're considering the following tracks for the next cohort:

### 🧑‍💻 Personhood Credential Track
- Build scalable, privacy-preserving identity verification systems  
- Tackle the hard problems of decentralized personhood  
- **Strategic Tie-In**: Human-Centric Identity & Privacy  
- **Opportunity**: *First Person Project* — led by Drummond, connecting ToIP, Customer Commons, and others

### 🧾 Content Authenticity / Assertions
- Develop tooling and frameworks to verify digital content  
- Help fight misinformation and reinforce trust  
- **Opportunity**: Collaboration with *C2PA*

### 🔐 Cryptography
- Push forward applied cryptographic tools for identity  
- Engage cryptography researchers and practitioners  
- **Focus**: ZKPs, *Cursive*, and foundational primitives

### 🤖 Verifiable AI
- Define mechanisms for verifying AI-generated outputs  
- Ensure transparency and build trust in AI systems  
- **Opportunity**: Partner with AI orgs to define verifiability standards

### 🏭 Industry-Aligned Tracks
- Align with go-to-market needs and industry use cases  
- Focus: **Operationalizing Privacy Tech, Industrial IoT**  
- **Example**: *H&T project*
