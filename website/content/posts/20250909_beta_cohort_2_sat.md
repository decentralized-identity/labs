## Overview

Over the past three months, three incredible projects from the **DIF Labs Beta Cohort 2** have been working intensively to
refine and advance groundbreaking proposals since beginning their development phase on June 24, 2025. These projects represent cutting-edge
innovation in decentralized identity, tackling real-world challenges with fresh perspectives and novel approaches.

The **DIF Labs Show and Tell** is the culmination of this journey—a chance to showcase the hard work, insights, and
progress made during the cohort. This is your opportunity to see these projects in action, engage with their creators,
and contribute to the vibrant ecosystem of decentralized identity.

Please join us on **[September 23]((https://luma.com/849iikfj))** to hear from these projects and learn more about what they've accomplished.

## Project Details

### Legally-Binding Proof of Personhood for Verifiable Credentials via QES
**Timeline:** May 31, 2025 - August 31, 2025  
**Leads:** Jon Bauer, Roberto Carvajal

This proposal creates a standardized method to anchor Verifiable Credentials to legally recognized, high-assurance proof of an individual's identity through Qualified Electronic Signatures (QES). QES, recognized by eIDAS in the European Union, represent the highest level of electronic signature, carrying the same legal weight as a handwritten signature. By creating a standardized mechanism to attach a QES to any VC, we can bind that credential to the strong proof of personhood and KYC attributes inherent in the QES.

### Privacy-Preserving Revocation Mechanism
**Timeline:** May 20, 2025 - August 31, 2025  
**Leads:** Kai Otsuki, Ken Watanabe

This project delivers a comprehensive analysis of privacy-preserving revocation mechanisms for Verifiable Credentials. It catalogues real-world revocation scenarios, benchmarks leading cryptographic mechanisms (status lists, dynamic accumulators, zk-SNARK proofs, short-term credentials), and provides an open-source prototype that evaluates computational costs for Issuers, Holders, and Verifiers. The work bridges the gap between cryptographic research and practical VC deployments.

### Anonymous Multi-Signature Verifiable Credentials
**Timeline:** May 20, 2025 - August 31, 2025  
**Leads:** Seohee Park, Lukas Han

This proposal outlines a protocol for VC issuance that requires m-of-n multi-signature approval while maintaining anonymity of individual signers. Using Semaphore, it enables decentralized governance for VC issuance in organizations such as DAOs or government agencies, cryptographically proving sufficient participation without revealing the identities of participating members. The protocol maintains compatibility with existing VC formats like W3C VCDM and IETF SD-JWT VC.
