        "long_description": "This proposal outlines a framework built on the did:btco method, associating DIDs with specific ordinals for tamper-proof digital artifacts. By leveraging Bitcoinâ€™s security and decentralization, it aims to enable on-chain verifiable credentials for use cases such as event tickets, ownership records, and AI-generated content. Emphasis is on privacy, scalability, and seamless integration with existing W3C VC and DID standards.",

This ensures that verifiers can evaluate chains of trust based on their own roots of trust. The work includes finalizing the high-level spec for LinkedClaims, organizing stakeholder workshops, and producing libraries for implementers. The intended result is a lightweight open standard facilitating decentralized and progressively built trust.",

Managers verify user identity documents, adding their Semaphore identity commitments to a group. Subjects then generate zero-knowledge proofs to show membership without revealing their actual identities. This approach helps prevent large-scale bot account creation and enhances privacy across various service providers, all while preserving unique personhood claims.",
